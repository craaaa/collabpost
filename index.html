		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Umberto Eco writes in The Name of the Rose, “<i>Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus</i>” — “the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names”. The concept of love is at once over-used and under-defined, a word that conveys a world of implications, and yet is at heart a “naked name”. How do we clothe this concept — what sources do we draw from? What similarities arise across our responses? And how might we integrate other perspectives into our own worldviews?</p>

		<p>This project is not (just) an investigation about love, but also an investigation into what meaning is. We set out, using love as a medium, to explore what meaning people ascribe to a concept, how we arrive at these meanings, and whether and how meaning can be generalized across individuals.</p>

		<p class="row">We interviewed 24 students from the University Scholars Programme (USP), asking them about love - <a href="#part1">what it means to them</a>, <a href="#part2">how they arrived at their definitions of love</a>, and <a href="#part3">their thoughts about other meanings of love</a>. What our interviewees shared varied in origin and tone, intimacy and brevity, and provided interesting views and insights about love and meaning.</p>

				<h3>“What does love mean to you?”</h3>

				<p>Most stare in shock and disbelief. Some cringe. Our discomfort and shock reveals the rarity of such discussions in Singapore, where love is a largely private – not public – matter. Interestingly, topics such as <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/dating-apps-a-hit-as-singles-access-huge-database-of-peers-searching-for-romance">casual dating</a>, <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-young-singles-do-not-intend-to-marry-and-more-have-not-dated-seriously-marriage-and">later marriages</a> and <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fewer-marriages-more-divorces-in-2016-singstat-9040550">rising divorces</a> are reported in newspapers with little to no mention of love.</p>

				<p>Despite <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/18/love-study-_n_5508965.html">how exposed</a> we are to the idea of love, love is something we have not thought seriously about before. <b>We do not have a ready answer</b>, and we push our friends to respond first. Uncertainty commonly surrounds our answers. We use fillers, and even try to check the quality of our answers with the interviewers.</p>

				<p>Our attempts reflect a need for our answers to be validated, and a cognizance that there is a wider meaning of love than that which is presented in our answers.</p>

				<p>One response suggests that love is purely biological – “a chemical reaction”. This is echoed by Rick from <i>Rick and Morty</i>, who says <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/Fa7t7f0">“what people call 'love' is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed”</a>. This perspective signals that everyone experiencing love experiences the same type of chemical reaction. Well, if so, then there should only be different intensities of experience, with little or even no variety in experiences. Furthermore, this biological view raises several questions on love. Can we create love in a laboratory? Is love purely functional?</p>

				<p>Another thought-provoking response claims that love is a label on the relationship between two people. If so, then does love have any meaning in itself? The idea that love is a construct is hardly new: books and even <a href="https://youtu.be/s7w0eqUBp3c">songs</a> have been written about it.</p>

				<p>Terms such as <b>trust</b>, <b>sacrifice</b>, <b>togetherness</b> and <b>care</b> recur often in our answers. Rather than showing similar conceptions of love, these similarities problematize the specificity of language in expression. Two could use the same word to describe love, yet mean different things. If we apply Wittgenstein's <a href="https://youtu.be/x86hLtOkou8">beetle-in-a-box analogy</a>, replacing “beetle” with “love”, can we ever express what love means? Is it possible to communicate our private meaning of love? Or to understand someone else’s private conception of love?</p>

				<p>What we do identify is that <b>love is, unsurprisingly, multifaceted</b>. There are so many different types of love, and to each of us, we hold different views and perspectives on what love is, each with our personal meaning and significance.</p>

				<h3>“How did you arrive at your meaning of love?”</h3>

				<p>Although we make sense of information and experiences every day, it is hard to put our finger on the processes by which we associate meaning with the words that we use.</p>

				<p>The meaning that we ascribe to concepts or words is heavily influenced by many inputs, including lived experiences, introspection, observations and what others tell us among many others.</p>

				<p>We derive meaning through our <b>personal experiences</b> – from expressions of care shown to us by our family, friends, and romantic partners, and from the love we express in turn. We draw from the emotions we felt, the choices we made, the actions we took; all these are involved in how and what we describe love to be.</p>

				<p>Besides what we have personally experienced, that which we learn of, by means of <b>direct observation or through the stories we hear from those around us</b>, or even through the media. These inform our understanding of concepts, especially in the absence of stories of our own. </p>

				<p>Yet, observations and second-hand encounters might not always convey the most accurate information. What we notice is assumed to be an accurate representation of lived reality. However, it may not be so. People may <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EFHbruKEmw">hide or exaggerate their emotions</a>, and much transpires in private spaces which outsiders are not privy to. Furthermore, stories generally incline to the extremes: people tend to share more about the highs and lows, rather than the everyday and mundane, resulting in <a href="http://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Experts-say-social-media-is-construing-the-reality-of-life-435499973.html">skewed representations</a>.</p>

				<p>Our <b>worldview and beliefs</b> naturally also shape the way we think, and partake in the process in which we attribute meaning to words. For instance, Judeo-Christian beliefs have a strong narrative about what love is, and this colours the way Christians think about love. However, even within a particular worldview, there are variations on the meanings ascribed: one may associate love with sacrifice, alluding to the sacrifice of Christ, while another to forgiveness, pointing to that which Jesus achieved through his sacrifice. </p>

				<h3>“One of our interviewees said that love is ________. <br>What do you think about that?”</h3>

				<p>When presented with a meaning of love that is different from our own, we generally do not immediately dismiss it, simply because it is different. We <b>try to identify with it</b>, and think of how this meaning of love could have arisen. At times, this alternative meaning could have been something that we considered, or we see merit in thinking of love in such a manner. </p>

				<p>This occurs, first and foremost, as <b>we understand that our meaning of love is not the sole or definitive meaning that love holds</b>. There is an awareness that love is deeply complex and layered. We may have chosen to focus on a particular aspect or type of love in our meaning, or we may have different views regarding love, be it in terms of what constitutes love, and the extent to which different aspects play in comprising love. One’s meaning of love rarely is able to completely encompass the vastness that love can signify, and other meanings of love can be just as valid.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, the meanings that we associate with love are <b>deeply personal</b>, and borne out of our experiences, beliefs or the stories of those around us, and much more. They bear a unique significance to each individual, and simply, who are we to dismiss or invalidate someone else’s meaning?</p>

				<p>Nonetheless, <b>we still evaluate this alternative meaning</b>. There is no outright dismissal, but judgments can still be made. We stand by our own meaning, and the experiences that constitute our meaning, and assess this new alternative meaning on those grounds: “Are there similarities between this new meaning and my own? Does my meaning encompass this new meaning, or vice versa? Does this align with my experiences?” We tease out connections between the two, while differentiating them where they do not align, to form our opinions about this new meaning.</p>

		<h1>“What do you mean?”</h1>
		<p>We have so many different meanings of love, and love is indeed a concept that is not easily distilled or drilled down into a simple definition. For that matter, is it even possible to do so, and would it even be useful?</p>

		<p>In talking about an abstract and complex concept such as <i>love</i>, meaning takes on a personal tone - “what do you mean?” is no longer “what do we (or the dictionary) define the word to be” –– the arbiter of meaning is <i>you</i>. Definitions, decided by convention, by society, by the way a word is used, cease to be useful. These definitions exist to facilitate communication, through our language, and a common understanding of what words refer to, but what happens when we speak of different things with the same word?</p>

		<p class="row">Ferdinand de Saussure suggested that the relationship between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5vhq3aRNjE">signifiers (words) and signifieds (concepts) is purely arbitrary</a> – that the word “love” might be an empty vessel, filled differently by each language, culture, and even each person. In practice, words like “love” are used seamlessly in our everyday conversations irrespective of their definitive meanings. What I mean by “love” may be different from your meaning, but somehow we seem to be able to communicate with one another. Perhaps this points to a shared signified underlying our flawed verbal representations – like <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant”>blind men encountering an elephant</a>, we can know and articulate only those parts of the whole which we have ourselves experienced, yet, somehow we have some common understanding and agreement that the elephant that each of us refer to is the same creature.</p>
