		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Umberto Eco writes in The Name of the Rose, “<i>Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus</i>” — “the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names”. The concept of love is at once over-used and under-defined, a word that conveys a world of implications, and yet is at heart a “naked name”. How do we clothe this concept — what sources do we draw from? What similarities arise across our responses? And how might we integrate other perspectives into our own worldviews?</p>

		<p>This project is not (just) an investigation about love, but about what meaning is. We set out, using love as a medium, to explore what meaning people ascribe to a concept, how we arrive at these meanings, and whether and how meaning can be generalized across individuals.</p>

		<p class="row">We interviewed 24 students from the University Scholars Programme (USP), asking them about love - <a href="#part1">what it means to them</a>, <a href="#part2">how they arrived at their definitions of love</a>, and <a href="#part3">their thoughts about other meanings of love</a>. What our interviewees shared varied in origin and tone, intimacy and brevity, and provided interesting views and insights about love and meaning.</p>

				<h3>“What does love mean to you?”</h3>

				<p>Most stare in shock and disbelief. Some cringe. Our discomfort and shock reveals the rarity of such discussions in Singapore, where love is a largely private – not public – matter. Interestingly, topics such as casual dating, later marriages and rising divorces are reported in newspapers with little to no mention of love.</p>

				<p>Despite <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/18/love-study-_n_5508965.html">how exposed</a> we are to the idea of love, love is something we have not thought seriously about before. We do not have a ready answer, and we push our friends to respond first. Uncertainty commonly surrounds our answers. We use fillers, and even try to check the quality of our answers with the interviewers.</p>

				<p>Our attempts reflect a need for our answers to be validated, and a cognizance that there is a wider meaning of love than that which is presented in our answers.</p>

				<p>One of us suggests that love is purely biological – “a chemical reaction”. This is echoed by Rick from <i>Rick and Morty</i>, who says <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/Fa7t7f0">“what people call 'love' is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed”</a>. This perspective signals that everyone experiencing love experiences the same type of chemical reaction. Well, if so, then there should only be different intensities of experience, with little or even no variety in experiences. Furthermore, this biological view raises several questions on love. Can we create love in a laboratory? Is love purely functional?</p>

				<p>Another thought-provoking response claims that love is a label on the relationship between two people. If so, then does love have any meaning in itself? The idea that love is a construct is hardly new: books and even <a href="https://youtu.be/s7w0eqUBp3c">songs</a> have been written about it.</p>

				<p>Terms such as trust, sacrifice, togetherness and care recur often in our answers. Rather than showing similar conceptions of love, these similarities problematize the specificity of language in expression. Two could use the same word to describe love, yet mean different things. If we apply Wittgenstein's <a href="https://youtu.be/x86hLtOkou8">beetle-in-a-box analogy</a>, replacing “beetle” with “love”, can we ever express what love means? Is it possible to communicate our private meaning of love? Or to understand someone else’s private conception of love?</p>

				<p>What we do identify is that love is, unsurprisingly, multifaceted. There are so many different types of love, and to each of us, we hold different views and perspectives on what love is, each with our personal meaning and significance.</p>

				<p>The next question aimed to understand how participants produced their definition of love.</p>

				<p>Although there are various ways of meaning-making, the most popular methods used by the participants were lived experiences, introspection, and observation.</p>

				<p>Lived experiences of the respondents shaped their meaning-making process. These lived experiences varied, where some drew their answers from particular events in their life, while others reflected on their personal experiences in romantic relationships. The experiences may not necessarily be romantic in nature as well, where one had discussed with friends about the definition of love prior to the interview, and tapped on that experience to derive her definition of love.</p>

				<p>Introspection was also a common way of meaning-making among our participants. Many imagined how they would act towards their loved ones, and tried to pinpoint how they felt love from their family and friends.</p>

				<p>Many also observed the relationships of their friends and/or parents. This observation could be first-hand or second-hand, whereby their friends shared personal stories with them. More than pure observation, one respondent disagreed with her friends’ decisions when they were in relationships, and this affected how she saw love.</p>

				<p>There was a smaller group of participants who realised that their definitions were influenced by their external environments, such as societal influences and pop culture. One respondent saw love as going beyond gender boundaries because of the environment he grew up in. Another participant attributed his definition of love on pop culture, which has been shown to promote the importance and desirability of love [3].</p>

				<p>An interesting observation was made by comparing two respondents whose meaning-making process had the same influence. Both were influenced by Christianity, but gave different definitions of love. One pointed to sacrifice and how this definition was shaped by the Christian belief that the ultimate expression of love was sacrifice. However, the other respondent defined love as forgiveness.</p>

				<p>The background of the respondents also affected the influences behind their meaning making process. Those who had never been in a relationship tended to be more uncertain of their responses, and based their definitions of love on observation. Atharv: That’s all I can think of now. Huijia: idk alot about romantic love...</p>
