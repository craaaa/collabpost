		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>This project is an investigation about what meaning is. We set out to explore what meaning people ascribe to a concept, how we arrive at these meanings, and whether meaning can be generalized across individuals. In particular, we chose to look at the meaning of the word love.</p>

		<p>Why did we choose love? Umberto Eco writes in The Name of the Rose, “Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus” -- “the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names”. The concept of love is uniquely placed for our research question: at once over-used and under-defined, it is a word that conveys a world of implications, and yet is a “naked name”. We were interested to see how individuals would clothe the concept -- what sources would they draw from? What would be similar across responses? And how would people integrate other perspectives into their own worldview?</p>

		<p class="row">To keep our sample group as uniform as possible, we interviewed 24 students from the University Scholars Programme. Despite this, the responses we received were varied in origin, tone, intimacy, brevity and ___. Held together, we hope this study provides insight into how we make meaning, and how __?!?!________.</p>

				<p>We interviewed a total of 24 students from the University Scholars Programme on “What does love mean to you?”. While there was a diverse range of responses, some commonalities in reactions and answers surfaced as well.</p>

				<h3>Reactions</h3>

				<p>The initial reaction of all interviewees was shock. Most laughed awkwardly and took some time to think about their responses. This revealed that despite the prevalence of love in today’s culture [1], many did not have a ready answer.</p>

				<p>In addition to most formulating their definition of love on the spot, many participants were also uncertain about their definition. Many used fillers frequently and in some instances, participants attempted to check with the interviewers regarding the quality of their answer.</p>

				<p>Some readily admitted that they do not know what love means to them. One participant disclosed that he could not verbalise his thoughts on love fully, while three others acknowledged that they do not have a specific definition. A reason given for the lack of knowledge on the definition of love was their lack of understanding of the concept itself.</p>

				<h3>Answers</h3>

				<p>Responses from the concrete to the abstract. One group saw love as a conscious decision involving actions. In contrast, a participant remarked that love is a huge fundamental concept.</p>

				<p>However, certain themes could be discerned from the responses given by participants.</p>

				<p>A significant number of respondents saw love as a union. This is similar to the theory that love is a union [2]. Participants cited the coming together of two individuals and the ability to rely on another consistently as their definitions of love. One claimed that love is a label on the relationship between two people.</p>

				<p>Another group saw love as being selfless to varying degrees. Some saw love as unconditional, where one would not expect to receive anything in return. Others saw love as sacrifice and compromise, which consisted of giving up some desires and preferences for the sake of the other. However, there were also competing views. One mentioned that love ideally is reciprocal while another claimed that love is based on mutual benefit.</p>

				<p>A third category of definitions stated that love is a positive feeling and emotion. These feelings include mutual attraction, comfort, acceptance, trust, and care. In contrast, a respondent claimed that love is simply a chemical reaction and the result of interaction between different hormones.</p>

				<p>Through the responses and reactions given by our participants, we realised that there are many definitions of love. However, there are some common themes, indicating that love is not completely unique to each individual. In addition, the most common type of love that came to the minds of participants was romantic love. This is evident from how many commented that the answers of other participants did not reflect romantic love despite the question not restricting the discussion to purely romantic love.</p>

				<p>The next question aimed to understand how participants produced their definition of love.</p>

				<p>Although there are various ways of meaning-making, the most popular methods used by the participants were lived experiences, introspection, and observation.</p>

				<p>Lived experiences of the respondents shaped their meaning-making process. These lived experiences varied, where some drew their answers from particular events in their life, while others reflected on their personal experiences in romantic relationships. The experiences may not necessarily be romantic in nature as well, where one had discussed with friends about the definition of love prior to the interview, and tapped on that experience to derive her definition of love.</p>

				<p>Introspection was also a common way of meaning-making among our participants. Many imagined how they would act towards their loved ones, and tried to pinpoint how they felt love from their family and friends.</p>

				<p>Many also observed the relationships of their friends and/or parents. This observation could be first-hand or second-hand, whereby their friends shared personal stories with them. More than pure observation, one respondent disagreed with her friends’ decisions when they were in relationships, and this affected how she saw love.</p>

				<p>There was a smaller group of participants who realised that their definitions were influenced by their external environments, such as societal influences and pop culture. One respondent saw love as going beyond gender boundaries because of the environment he grew up in. Another participant attributed his definition of love on pop culture, which has been shown to promote the importance and desirability of love [3].</p>

				<p>An interesting observation was made by comparing two respondents whose meaning-making process had the same influence. Both were influenced by Christianity, but gave different definitions of love. One pointed to sacrifice and how this definition was shaped by the Christian belief that the ultimate expression of love was sacrifice. However, the other respondent defined love as forgiveness.</p>

				<p>The background of the respondents also affected the influences behind their meaning making process. Those who had never been in a relationship tended to be more uncertain of their responses, and based their definitions of love on observation. Atharv: That’s all I can think of now. Huijia: idk alot about romantic love...</p>
