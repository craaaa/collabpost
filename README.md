## What do you mean?

Umberto Eco writes in The Name of the Rose, “Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus” — “the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names”. The concept of love is at once over-used and under-defined, a word that conveys a world of implications, and yet is at heart a “naked name”. How do we clothe this concept — what sources do we draw from? What similarities arise across our responses? And how might we integrate other perspectives into our own worldviews?
